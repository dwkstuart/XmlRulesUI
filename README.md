# XmlRulesUi

XmlRulesUi is a demo React application for building, editing, and managing rules in XML format. The app provides a user-friendly interface to create and modify bursary rules, visualize them, and export the rules as XML. It is designed to simplify the process of working with complex rule sets, making it accessible for users who need to define or update rules without directly editing XML files.

## Features
- Interactive rule builder for bursary rules
- Edit and manage existing rules
- Visualize rules and their logic
- Export rules to XML format
- Error handling and user feedback

## Technologies Used
- React (TypeScript)
- Vite (for development and build)
- Custom state management with Redux Toolkit
